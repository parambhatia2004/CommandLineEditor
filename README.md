# CommandLineEditor
The purpose of the file is to allow users to conduct different file operations.
The program will prompt the user to select an option from a variety of file operations.
The user input will then be validated, to ensure that the input is a valid number from 0-11
The program will then prompt user to enter the filename, and verify that such a file exists.
Then the program will call the relevant function in order to carry out the specified operation.
After each operation, the changelog function is called to add the operation to the log.
The log stores file name, and the operation carried out, as well number of lines in the file.
My additional features are as follows:
1)Searching through a file to see if a word exists in a file - which is useful if someone wants to know if a word is there in a file.
2)Word Counter - Checks for number of words in a file.
